  “Anyone who stops learning is old, whether at twenty or eighty. Anyone who keeps learning stays young.”

I start this blog as a record and showcase for the highlights of my *life long learning experience* as I graduate with my BASc degree in EE. I'm a firm believer of life long learning or as Assosiation of Professional Engineers and Geoscientist of British Columbia (APEGBC) puts it, [Continuing Professional Development](https://www.apeg.bc.ca/getmedia/a85a6b91-8a76-4e85-8795-8ebdf2decfd1/APEGBC-Continuing-Professional-Development-Guideline.pdf.aspx). 

I'm planning to cover a wide variety of engineering topics which might include advanced topics in feilds that are my expertise like power electronics, VLSI, FPGAs as well as things that are new but interesting to me such as machine learning, AI, RF engineering. If this short list my interests make you think that I'm completely lost and need to focus my attention on one subject, think agian. A great advantage of studying EE is that it give you the knowledge and tools to pursue almost any other feild in engineering (chemical is a different ball game) or computer science. Yes, I'm not yet a 100 percent on a feild that is my "true passion" or the "perfect fit" and frankly, I think I will never be. I'm in the game because Engineering is my true passion. I'm equally fascinated by tesla coils generating millions of volts as I am by integrated circuits with billions of transistors processing millivolt signals. An ac-dc converter running at 1Mhz is as cool as a FMCW radar operating at 77GHz. You get the idea.

I will eventually be more skilled in a feild that I chose to build my career around and I hope this blog will lead me to it. It also helps me with my writing skills which you might have already noticed is currently equivalent to a 6th grader's.

The online community of engineers, thinkers, hackers, science enthusiast and the like, have helped me tremendously throughout my years as a university student. Consider this my way of giving back to the community and I hope that many can find it useful and take advantage of it.
